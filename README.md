# 30 Days, 30 JavaScript Projects – HTML, CSS & JS Only

Welcome to my **30-Day JavaScript Project Challenge!** Over the next 30 days, I will build 30 unique and practical mini-projects using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** — no libraries, no frameworks.

Each day is dedicated to building one useful project that helps reinforce key concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.

## Why This Challenge?

This 30-day journey is meant to:
- Sharpen my JavaScript (ES6+) skills
- Deepen my understanding of core web technologies
- Build a strong, real-world project portfolio
- Boost consistency, creativity, and discipline

---

## Tools & Technologies

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  

No frameworks. No libraries. Just raw, clean code.
