# 30 JavaScript Projects with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

## Welcome to my 30 JavaScript Projects repository! This is where I challenge myself to build 30 unique and practical mini-projects using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no libraries or frameworks.

Each project will focus on core concepts of web development and provide hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI/UX principles.

Why I'm Doing This

This challenge is meant to:

Practice and reinforce modern JavaScript (ES6+)

Strengthen my understanding of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS

Build a strong portfolio with real-world examples

Improve consistency, creativity, and problem-solving

Technologies Used
